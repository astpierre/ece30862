ISA vs HASA (using Duck example)

                    class Duck
            /           |               \
class Mallard       class RedHead       class RubberDuck

When testing, we noticed RubberDuck does not fly...
    Solution 1) override the fly method
        - but this does not solve issue that base class has
          properties of ducks not for all ducks
        - ie. half the properties are needing to be
          overridden
    Solution 2) access levels and encapsulation

Want an ISA relationship
    - fundamental to what is going on
Want an HASA relationship
    - if you are constantly needing to override things

File extensions
    C++ programs have header files and code files
        header files: *.h or *.hpp
        code files: *.cc, *.cpp, *.c++, *.cp (and more)

Access levels and inheritance
    When inheriting, we can always make something
    more private, but cannot make it less private
    Always make things private unless you have
    a good reason to make something not private
